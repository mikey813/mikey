Hi everyone, I’m MIAO HONGBIN. I’m studying Computer Science, and I’m really excited to study with you all this semester. I’d say my strengths are being open-minded, easy to work with, and willing to take on challenges. I like learning from others and also sharing what I know, so I hope I can be a good teammate.
